# helloms
This repo contains a standalone test application that uses a Direct3D12 mesh shader. It was based off of the spinning cube sample code, see [here](https://github.com/clandrew/spinningcube12).

## Controls

1 (numerical key) - Input assembler mode

2 (numerical key) - Mesh shader mode

The current mode is written in the application title bar. If mesh shaders are not supported on the device, it says "Input Assembler only, Mesh Shaders not supported on device" in the title bar.
